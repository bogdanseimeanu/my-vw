        Golf Variant

    <h3>The new Golf Variant is versatile and dynamic – just like you! Unmistakeably a Variant from the exterior, with all the digital freedom of a Golf on the inside – digital and flexible.</h3>

      <h3>A system for changing lanes</h3>
      <p>The Side Assist lane change system uses an LED light in the exterior mirror to indicate when other vehicles are in your blind spot or driving up to 50 meters behind you.* If you indicate to change lanes, the system calculates whether the position or speed of a nearby vehicle poses a danger, and draws your attention to it by flashing the warning lights in the exterior mirrors.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>* Within the limits of the system. The driver must be prepared at all times to override the assist system and is in no way released from their responsibility to drive the vehicle with caution.</p>

      <h3>Digital features for more functionality</h3>
      <p>When combined with the optional “Discover Pro” radio navigation system, the Digital Cockpit Pro can be upgraded to the Innovision Cockpit. This means that both displays, measuring 10 inches (25.4 cm), can be merged together.</p>
      <p>The resulting display landscape not only contains classic content such as the rev counter, speedometer and odometer, but also other useful data in an even clearer and more detailed display. You can even set up favourite functions on the home screen, just like you would on your smartphone.</p>

      <h3>Opens doors and new possibilities</h3>
      <p>Daily life is full of challenges: how often have you stood at the back of the car, child in one arm and bags in the other, without a hand free to open the boot? With the optional „Easy Open” function, all you have to do to open the luggage compartment lid is move your foot under the rear of the vehicle.<p>
      <p>Here you can expect a generous loading volume of up to 1,642 litres and a height-adjustable, flexible luggage compartment floor. The low loading edge also allows you to store your shopping easily. Afterwards, simply press the interior button and the boot lid shuts automatically.</p>
