        Touareg
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <h3>Sublime comfort and next generation technology in a truly thoroughbred off-roader. Nothing drives like the Touareg.</h3>

      <h3>A sportier profile</h3>
      <p>The R-Line gives the interior of your new Touareg a sportier feel, but doesn’t compromise on comfort. Decorative aluminium inserts immediately catch the eye while the heated leather multi-function steering wheel, bearing the R-Line logo, ensures warm hands for every journey. The sill panel trim around the car also bears the emblematic R-Line logo, which can be attractively illuminated by the optional ambience package. Both the pedals and footrest are created from stainless steel to compliment the clean, dynamic feel.</p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Blue skies await</h3>
      <p>Fresh air, a clear view of the sky and a feeling of boundless freedom, all at the touch of a button. The new Touareg’s tilting and sliding panoramic sunroof stretches from front to back, giving you and your passengers an impressive feeling and space and light. Perfect for those days when you want to feel the wind in your hair.</p>

    <div class="car-desc">
      <h3>Discover the beauty within</h3>
      <p>Each interior option has been carefully crafted to deliver total comfort for you and your passengers. The trim is coupled with the natural tones of “Vienna” leather. As an alternative, you can opt for the sumptuous two-tone “Savona” leather seats. As an extra decadent touch, ergoComfort seats can be added to provide supreme lumbar support.</p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Room to manoeuvre</h3>
      <p>The new Touareg’s generous proportions give you the freedom to move. The boot combined with the sliding and foldable rear seat are particularly impressive: they use a 40:20:40 ratio that makes them hugely flexible. And for even more convenience, you can use the optional Easy Open package to open the boot with the touch of a button or even with a wave of your foot if you’re standing by the car and have the key with you.</p>

      <h3>Riding on air</h3>
      <p>The new Touareg uses air suspension to give you quite literally the highest level of driving comfort: it adapts the height of the car to all terrains, and gives you the option of “COMFORT”, “NORMAL” OR “SPORT” driving profiles so you’re in complete control of your ride. The car can also be raised to give you 258 mm ground clearance, or lowered to make loading and unloading easier.</p>

      <br/>

      <h3>Precision and agility</h3>
      <p>You may not expect a luxury SUV to deliver such sporty performance, but the new Touareg doesn’t disappoint. Electro-mechanical active roll stabilisation reacts more quickly and at lower speeds than conventional stabilisers, reducing lateral tilt and understeer. So you can drive with precision and agility, even on rough terrain.</p>
